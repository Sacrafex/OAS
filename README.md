## To-Do before official Release:

Work on a backend to host the files. (I will host this myself once It is finished. This is located in /backend in the Repo)

Improve Styling

Improve Chart.js implementation (Add features for viewer.html using chart.js)

Fix Viewer.html and Seperate the output for Public Users and Local Users

## Install

There are two ways to use OAS for your team. You can host yourself, or use the public service which is default.

## - Public Install

Go to the [Default Page](https://sacrafex.github.io/OAS/default.html) and submit your data from there. All details can be filled out on this page. No Installation needed.

For data analysts / Programmers - Data can be viewed on the [Viewer Page](https://sacrafex.github.io/OAS/viewer.html). Make sure settings are correct when using it.

## - Local Host Install

Create your own scouting data point [here](https://sacrafex.github.io/OAS/editor.html) or use the one from the public directory. Host this json file on a server and put the link on every device connected to the service inside the [Default Page](https://sacrafex.github.io/OAS/default.html).

For data analysts / Programmers - Data can be viewed on the [Viewer Page](https://sacrafex.github.io/OAS/viewer.html). Make sure settings are correct when using it.
